# Notes: When to Use Inline, Internal, and External CSS  

CSS can be applied in **three main ways**. Each has its own definition, use case, and drawbacks.  

---

## 1. Inline CSS  
- **Definition:** CSS is written directly inside an element’s `style` attribute.  
- **Example:**  
  ```html
  <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is inline styled text.</p>
When to use:

For quick testing or very small changes.

When you want to override styles for just one specific element.

Drawbacks:

Not reusable.

Clutters the HTML.

Hard to maintain in larger projects.

2. Internal CSS
Definition: CSS is written inside a <style> tag within the HTML file (inside <head>).

Example:


<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      background-color: lightgray;
    }
  </style>
</head>
When to use:

For small projects or single-page websites.

When you don’t need multiple HTML files sharing the same CSS.

Drawbacks:

Makes the HTML file bigger.

Cannot be reused across multiple pages.

3. External CSS
Definition: CSS is placed in a separate .css file and linked using <link> inside the HTML <head>.

Example:


<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
css

/* style.css */
h1 {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}
When to use:

For medium to large projects.

When multiple pages share the same styling.

Best for maintainability and clean code structure.

Drawbacks:

Requires an additional HTTP request (but can be cached).

Slight delay in loading styles compared to inline/internal.

✅ Summary:

Use Inline CSS → For quick fixes or one-off elements.

Use Internal CSS → For small projects or single-page apps.

Use External CSS → For big projects, reusable styles, and professional development.
