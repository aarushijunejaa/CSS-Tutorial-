Summary (Day 2 – CSS Selectors)

Element, Class, ID selectors →

Element selector applies to all tags of that type (e.g., all <div>).

Class selector (.) lets you style multiple elements that share the same class.

ID selector (#) applies to one unique element with that specific ID.

Child vs Descendant selectors →

Child selector (>) only targets the direct children of a parent (e.g., <div > p> affects only <p> directly inside <div>).

Descendant selector (space) targets all nested elements inside, no matter how deep (e.g., <div p> affects <p> inside <div>, even if wrapped in <article>).

Universal selector (*) →

Targets every element on the page.

Commonly used to reset margins and paddings for a consistent base.

Pseudo-classes (links) →

:link → styles for unvisited links.

:visited → styles for links already visited.

:hover → styles when the user hovers over the link.

:active → styles when the link is being clicked.
